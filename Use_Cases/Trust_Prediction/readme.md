# Trust Prediction

## Overview

This repository implements a recommendation system based on the principles outlined in the paper "Leveraging Community Detection for Accurate Trust Prediction". At a high level, our system uses community detection to enhance the prediction of trust relationships, which in turn improves the accuracy of recommendations by leveraging trust among users.

## How It Works

1. **Community Detection**: 
   - The system first identifies communities within the user base using various community detection algorithms. This step is crucial as it groups users with similar trust relationships together.
   
2. **Trust Prediction**:
   - Within these identified communities, the system predicts trust relationships between users. This step helps in understanding the trust dynamics within each community.
   
3. **Recommendation Generation**:
   - The final recommendations are generated by combining the predicted trust relationships with traditional collaborative filtering techniques. This method aims to provide personalized recommendations by leveraging the trust and community structure among users.

## Evaluating the Model

To evaluate whether our trust prediction framework is better or not, we use the following metrics:

### Evaluation Process

1. **Performance Analysis**: Analyze the results to determine if our system provides significant improvements in prediction based on ground truth trust relations.


## How This Code Works

This codebase implements the concepts from the paper "A Community-Based Collaborative Filtering Method for Social Recommender Systems" with some modifications to suit our specific use case.

1. **Overlapping Communitiess**:
   - Ensure the output file of communities in json format:
     ```bash
     ./script.sh
     ```
     
2. **Non-Overlapping Communities**:
   - Ensure the output file of communities in csv format:
     ```bash
     ./script.sh

## Reference

This code is based on the methodologies and concepts presented in the paper:
- "Leveraging Community Detection for Accurate Trust Prediction"

By following these steps and utilizing the provided scripts, you can implement any trust prediction tailored to your specific needs. Feel free to modify the code to better suit your application and improve the prediction quality.
