# Recommendation System

## Overview

This repository implements a recommendation system based on the principles outlined in the paper "A Community-Based Collaborative Filtering Method for Social Recommender Systems". At a high level, our system leverages community detection algorithms to enhance the collaborative filtering process, providing more accurate and relevant recommendations by considering the social context of users.

## How It Works

1. **Community Detection**: 
   - The system first identifies communities within the user base using various community detection algorithms. This step is crucial as it groups users with similar interests or behaviors together.
   
2. **Collaborative Filtering**:
   - Within these identified communities, the system applies collaborative filtering techniques to recommend items. This approach ensures that the recommendations are more relevant by considering the preferences of similar users within the same community.
   
3. **Recommendation Generation**:
   - The final recommendations are generated by combining the results from the collaborative filtering process within each community. This method aims to provide personalized recommendations by leveraging the social connections and similarities among users.

## Evaluating Model Papers

To determine if a model paper is good or not, consider the following criteria:
- **Relevance**: Ensure the paper addresses the specific problem or domain you are interested in.
- **Citations**: High citation count often indicates that the paper is well-regarded in the research community.
- **Novelty**: Check if the paper introduces novel concepts or methodologies that advance the field.
- **Experimental Results**: Review the experimental results to see if the proposed method outperforms existing techniques.
- **Peer Reviews**: Look for papers published in reputable journals or conferences, which typically undergo rigorous peer review.

## How This Code Works

This codebase implements the concepts from the paper "A Community-Based Collaborative Filtering Method for Social Recommender Systems" with some modifications to suit our specific use case.

1. **Setup and Dependencies**:
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed by running:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - Prepare your dataset according to the format specified in the `data/` directory. Ensure the data includes user interactions and relevant metadata.

3. **Running the Community Detection**:
   - Navigate to the appropriate script for community detection in the `models/` directory and run:
     ```bash
     python community_detection.py
     ```

4. **Collaborative Filtering**:
   - Use the detected communities to perform collaborative filtering by running:
     ```bash
     python collaborative_filtering.py
     ```

5. **Generating Recommendations**:
   - Finally, generate the recommendations by combining the results from the collaborative filtering step:
     ```bash
     python generate_recommendations.py
     ```
