# Recommendation System

## Overview

This repository implements a recommendation system based on the principles outlined in the paper "A Community-Based Collaborative Filtering Method for Social Recommender Systems". At a high level, our system leverages community detection algorithms to enhance the collaborative filtering process, providing more accurate and relevant recommendations by considering the social context of users.

## How It Works

1. **Community Detection**: 
   - The system first identifies communities within the user base using various community detection algorithms. This step is crucial as it groups users with similar interests or behaviors together. We are replacing the mentioned community detection method in the paper by the methods in 'models' directory from non-overlapping to overlapping. 
   
2. **Collaborative Filtering**:
   - Within these identified communities, the system applies collaborative filtering techniques to recommend items. This approach ensures that the recommendations are more relevant by considering the preferences of similar users within the same community.
   
3. **Recommendation Generation**:
   - The final recommendations are generated by combining the results from the collaborative filtering process within each community. This method aims to provide personalized recommendations by leveraging the social connections and similarities among users.

## Evaluating Model 

To evaluate whether your recommendation framework is better or not, you need to compare its performance against baseline methods and metrics typically used in the field of recommender systems. Here's how you can approach this evaluation based on the methodologies discussed in the paper "A Community-Based Collaborative Filtering Method for Social Recommender Systems":

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: This metric measures the average magnitude of errors in the recommendations, providing a straightforward interpretation of the prediction accuracy.
- **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: This metric gives higher weight to larger errors, offering insight into the variability of the recommendation errors.

### Evaluation Process

1. **Baseline Comparison**: Compare the performance of our recommendation system against baseline methods such as traditional collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.
2. **Metrics Calculation**: Calculate MAE and RMSE for both our system and the baselines to measure the accuracy and precision of the recommendations.

## How This Code Works

This codebase implements the concepts from the paper "A Community-Based Collaborative Filtering Method for Social Recommender Systems" with some modifications to suit our specific use case.

1. **Setup and Dependencies**:
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed by running:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - Prepare your dataset according to the format specified in the `data/` directory. Ensure the data includes user interactions and relevant metadata.

3. **Running the Community Detection**:
   - Navigate to the appropriate script for community detection in the `models/` directory and run:
     ```bash
     python community_detection.py
     ```

4. **Collaborative Filtering**:
   - Use the detected communities to perform collaborative filtering by running:
     ```bash
     python collaborative_filtering.py
     ```

5. **Generating Recommendations**:
   - Finally, generate the recommendations by combining the results from the collaborative filtering step:
     ```bash
     python generate_recommendations.py
     ```
